# RestartJewTrick
Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 mod that automatically joins 2b2t.org after it restarts

# are there any settings???
Yes.
Get into your modlist, select this mod and then the "Config" should appear on bottom left corner

# how the fuck do i use this thing????
1. Run the game atleast 1 time with this mod
2. Add SOCKS5 proxies in .minecraft/rjt_proxy.txt (or whatever file you specified in mod settings)

(**NOTE: The proxies itself should be able to let you use them without asking for login and password**)

3. Go to your server list and click the "Reload proxy list" button
4. Whenever the server is about to restart, click the "2b2t checker" button
5. Done
