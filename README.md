# RestartJewTrick (also known to some as MoneyMod)
Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 modification that automatically joins 2b2t.org after it restarts

# are there any settings???
Yes, go into your modlist, select this mod and then the "Config" button should appear in the bottom left corner

# how the fuck do i add proxies????
1. Run the game atleast 1 time with this mod
2. Add SOCKS5 proxies (or 1 would be enough) in .minecraft/rjt_proxy.txt (or whatever file you specified in mod settings)

(**NOTE: The proxies itself should be able to let you use them without asking for login and password**)

3. Go to your server list and click on the "Reload proxy list" button
4. Done

# how the fuck do i use this thing????
When the server is about to restart, go to your server list and click on the "2b2t checker" button

# this shit fucking sucks i keep getting disconnected
cant do shit about it lol
go fuck yourself
